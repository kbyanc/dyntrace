This directory contains various patches to FreeBSD to implement new
functionality or fix existing bugs with regards to dynamic profiling
of processes.

All diffs are against FreeBSD 5.3.  Where noted, these patches have
been committed to FreeBSD's source repository to be included in future
releases.

trace-fix.diff
	Fixes a bug in the i386 machine-dependent portion of the fork(2)
	implementation in which the trap flag was copied from the parent
	to the child process.  This bug caused all children of processes
	being single-stepped under the control of a debugger to dump
	core immediately on return from the fork(2) call.  The cause was
	that the processor generates a SIGTRAP because the trap flag is
	set; the parent is under the control of a debugger which
	intercepts the signal so the parent never receives the it,
	however the new child is not and hence does receive the signal.
	The default signal handler for SIGTERM is to dump core.

	This patch simply clears the PSL_T (trace enable bit) in trap
	frame of the newly-created process.  It cannot possible be under
	the control of a debugger yet so it does not make sense to try
	to trace it (and, as witnessed, only ends in disaster).
