 * Define output format.
   Three dimensions: opcode, prefix combination, memory region.
   Should probably add a flag to indicate whether to include opcodes
   with zero counts (default to not including them).
   <prefix id="A" bitmask="..." detail="..." />
   <region type="CODE">
	<opcode bitmask="..." mneumonic="ABC" detail="...">
		<count prefixes="" n="12" ... />
		<count prefixes="A,C" n="1" ... />
	</opcode>
   </region>

 * Add default "unknown" opcode to optree.
   Both key and mask should be all zeros (match anything).

 ** Send sample output to professor with progress update.

 * FreeBSD kernel modification to virtualize perfmon counters.

 * Use virtualized perfmon counters to track instruction execution time.

 * Perl script for grouping instructions.
   - File for specifying grouping (by mneumonic?).
   - Option of which memory region(s) to include.

 * Thread support.
   Need to set each new thread to single-step.  Once that is done,
   existing logic to handle maintaining single-step status.

 * Ability to diffentiate between types of memory regions.
   Three regions: CODE(program, library), STACK, HEAP.
   Keep separate counters for opcodes in each region.
   Separate optree per region?

 * Port to linux.

 * Port to Solaris.
